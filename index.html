			<p>Hi, I am a sophomore at the University of Tennessee Knoville studying Computer 
			Science. I also plan on minoring in cybersecurity and data science. My interest in
			the technology industry in high school through a course in which I learned
			some of the neat things you could do other than the simple surface level usage that
			most people know. This made me question what else is possible. My desire to pursue
			computer science was further encouraged by conversations with a teacher who
			coded for personal fulfillment, and he opened my eyes to some of the things he 
			as a non-professional could do.
